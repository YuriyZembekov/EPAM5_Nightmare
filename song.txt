Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends

Like my father come to pass
Seven yeats has gone so fast
Wake me up when September

Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are

As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
